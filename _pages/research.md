**Uncovering and understanding differences in health behaviours in people with diabetes (CASCARA)**  
During this Horizon 2020 Widening Fellowship I will explore the real-life effect of a diabetes diagnosis on health behaviours relevant for diabetes management and important to reduce risk factors for diabetes complications. So far, we know little about if behaviours change after a diagnosis and if so, who changes behaviours. Ultimately, the goal of this project is to provide evidence about which populations could be more directly targeted to increase behaviour change.

**Using financial incentives to increase physical activity among employees as a strategy of workplace health promotion (AFKAB)**  
Shifts towards sedentary occupations in high-income countries (HIC) over the last decades and the health burden associated with physical inactivity have led to innovative strategies to promote physical activity (PA) among the working population. Financial rewards have been proposed to incentivise participation in programmes promoting PA or the achievement of PA-related goals. This review will assess (1) effects of financial incentives provided by employers to promote PA on programme adherence/compliance, PA and closely linked outcomes (eg, days of sick leave), (2) effects according to age, gender, implementation and study quality and (3) intervention costs and cost-effectiveness. You can find more information about the project [here ing German](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101038046/). The published review protocol can be found [here](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/11/3/e042888.abstract)
