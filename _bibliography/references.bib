abstract = {The original cluster-randomised controlled trial took place in two provinces of Northern Ecuador. The trial compared cash, food or voucher assistance and found them to be effective. The results of the original paper are completely replicable and the findings of the original analysis are robust; however, we additionally find that treatments are more effective in the poorer province. We then extend the cost-effectiveness analysis by taking into account the parameter uncertainty in a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). Moreover, we provide information about the usefulness of additional research to reduce uncertainty concerning the cost-effectiveness analysis by calculating the expected value of perfect information (EVPI). Our extended cost-effectiveness analysis reveals that for some outcomes decision makers with a relatively small willingness-to-pay maybe a risk to choose a less cost-effective intervention. Furthermore, our findings indicate that further research into the comparative cost-effectiveness of these interventions could be worthwhile. This is in particular true for low-resource settings where decision makers face stricter budget constraints to finance interventions. In particular, policy makers with a small budget have a high risk of choosing a comparably less cost-effective treatment. Hence, further research to reduce uncertainty of effect estimates could aid decision-making.},

@article{Seuring2020a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V. We use longitudinal data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, covering the years 1997–2011, to estimate the effect of a diabetes diagnosis on an economic outcome (employment probabilities) and behavioural risk factors (alcohol consumption, smoking cessation, body mass index (BMI), physical activity and hypertension) for men and women. We apply two complementary statistical techniques—marginal structural models (MSMs) and fixed effects (FE) models—to deal with confounding. Both methods suggest, despite their different underlying assumptions, similar patterns that indicate important differences between men and women. Employment probabilities decline substantially after the diagnosis for women (−12.4 (MSM) and −15.5 (FE) percentage points), but do not change significantly for men. In particular, the MSM estimates indicate an increase in hypertension (13 percentage points) and a decrease in physical activity for women, while men have small and statistically insignificant changes in these outcomes. For BMI, the MSM results indicate statistically significant changes for men (−.76), but not for women, while the FE estimates show similar reductions for men and women (−.80 and −.73 respectively). Men also reduce their alcohol consumption, but do not cease to smoke. For women these risk factors have a prevalence close to zero to begin with, though women seem to still reduce alcohol consumption somewhat. These results suggest important gender differences in the impact of diabetes in China. To narrow these inequities policies supporting women to reduce diabetes related risk factors are likely important.},

abstract = {This paper examines the role of stabilization and savings funds for natural resource revenues in supporting a sustainable use of government oil revenues in and Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. We review the operational rules and performance of the two funds and compare these to the Norwegian petroleum fund, which is often viewed as a benchmark for good fiscal practices in this field. We conclude that the resource funds do not (and cannot ever) provide a magic bullet to deal conclusively with the twin temptations to decision-makers of spending too much resource revenue too soon, and of diverting expenditures to suit private interests rather than the public interest. However, the institutional framework of resource funds lends itself to enhancing the transparency and public scrutiny of fiscal operations. In time, greater transparency can lead to a system of checks and balances that will limit discretionary control over the use of resource revenues by small groups of decision-makers. Transparency can also enhance public support for saving substantial resource revenues to sustain government expenditures and private consumption after the resource has been depleted.},
